# bubbleSort
Very basic put-the-numbers-in-order sorter thing for my CS class. Uses ArrayLists.

It can handle arrays of size 0, 1, 2147483646, and anything else in between - but speed gets drastically slower the larger your array. Try and keep your arrays below 500 or so.

Why is it on GitHub? So I don't lose it in case I never need this and don't want to spend the 20 minutes it takes to rewrite.
